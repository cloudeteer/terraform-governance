To signify your agreement, simply add a `Signed-off-by` line to your commit message, using your real name and email address.

Here is an example of how you can add a `Signed-off-by` line to your commit message:

```plain
Signed-off-by: John Doe <john.doe@example.com>
```

By signing off your contribution, you acknowledge and agree to the following:

- You have the right to submit your contributions.
