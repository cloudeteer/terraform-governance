# Contribution Guide for Terraform Modules
Thank you for considering contributing to our open-source Terraform modules! We welcome all contributions to help improve
our modules and make them more robust.

## Getting Started
Create a branch in the Terraform module repository or fork the repository if you don't have write access.
Fork the Repository: If you haven't already, fork the repository on GitHub. This will create a copy of the repository under
your GitHub account.

1. Clone the Repository: Clone the Terraform module repository or your fork of the repository to your local machine using Git.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cloudeteer/terraform-azurerm-hello-world.git
   # or
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/terraform-azurerm-hello-world.git
   ```
2. Create a Branch: Create a new branch to work on your changes.
   ```bash
   git checkout -b my-feature
   ```
3. Make Changes: Make your desired changes to the module code or documentation. Ensure that your changes follow our coding
   standards and conventions.
4. Test Your Changes: Before submitting a pull request, make sure your changes work as expected. Run tests if available to
   ensure there are no regressions.
5. Commit Your Changes: Once you're satisfied with your changes, commit them to your branch.
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add my feature"
   ```
6. Push Your Changes: Push your changes to your fork on GitHub.
   ```bash
   git push origin my-feature
   ```

## Submitting a Pull Request
1. Open a Pull Request: Go to the GitHub page of your forked repository. You should see a notification prompting you to
   create a pull request. Click on it and fill out the pull request template with details about your changes.
2. Describe Your Changes: Provide a clear and concise description of the changes you've made in the pull request description.
   Include any relevant information that would help reviewers understand your contribution.
3. Wait for Review: Once you've submitted your pull request, our team will review your changes. We may ask for further
   clarification or suggest improvements.
4. Address Feedback: If any changes are requested, make the necessary adjustments to your branch and push the changes.
   The pull request will be automatically updated.
5. Merge Pull Request: Once your pull request has been approved, it will be merged into the main repository.  
   Congratulations on your contribution!
