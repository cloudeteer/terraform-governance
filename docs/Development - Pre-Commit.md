# Pre-Commit

## What is Pre-Commit
Pre-Commit is a powerful tool that helps developers make high-quality, consistent, and error-free code changes.
It integrates seamlessly into the development workflow, minimizes manual reviews,
and ensures that issues are detected earlyâ€”long before they reach the production environment.

## Should I use it?
In short: Yes!

Every Module-Repository has certain checks on a pull-request to prevent formatting and documentation errors.
By using pre-commit, all checks will be done locally and sometimes even be fixed automatacally, which increase productivity and decreas the hassel with
the pull-request checks.
