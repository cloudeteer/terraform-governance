# Pre-Commit

## What is Pre-Commit
Pre-Commit is a powerful tool that helps developers make high-quality, consistent, and error-free code changes.
It integrates seamlessly into the development workflow, minimizes manual reviews,
and ensures that issues are detected earlyâ€”long before they reach the production environment.

## Already in use
Every Module-Repository of us has certain checks on a pull-request to prevent formatting and documentation errors.
By using pre-commit, all checks will be done locally and sometimes even be fixed automatically, which increase productivity and decrease the hassle with
the pull-request checks.

## Installing
### Mac
`brew install pre-commit`

### Windows
:no_good:

### Linux
`pip install pre-commit`

### Enable Pre-Commit
Run this command in your local repository in which you want to use it:  
`pre-commit install`

## Pre-Commit Examples (we use)
In order to know what pre-commits are used in each repository,
look out for [pre-commit-config.yaml](https://github.com/cloudeteer/terraform-governance/blob/main/pre-commit-config.yaml),
but here are some simple examples to get in touch with it.
- terraform-docs
  - A utility to generate documentation from Terraform modules in various output formats.
- terraform-lint
  - Validates all Terraform configuration files with [TFLint](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint). [Available TFLint rules](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint-ruleset-terraform/blob/main/docs/rules/README.md). [Hook notes](https://github.com/antonbabenko/pre-commit-terraform?tab=readme-ov-file#terraform_tflint).
- end-of-file-fixer
  - Makes sure files end in a newline and only a newline.

## Skip Pre-Commit once
Not all Pre-Commit hooks are perfect, and sometimes you want to commit your code even if not all pre-commit hooks are successful.
To do so, just use the `--no-verify` option of git:  
`git commit --no-verify -m "commit message"`

## Uninstall
Just run in your local git repository:  
`pre-commit uninstall`
